              In the Acting Green CAT, we were tasked with creating a more sustainable home. I mainly focused on electricity consumption, 
              with all three strategies having something to do with it because of the high power consumption that we have. My implementations 
              helped a lot with the sustainability of my household, cutting significantly on energy usage. This was done by turning off, 
              reducing time on, and optimising the power consumption of devices, lights, and appliances. I saved on about 20 lights or 
              appliances, 42 watts of devices' power consumption, and cut in half the amount of power that the boiler uses for showers. 
              I also cut on water usage, as our shower lengths have been cut in half. These savings greatly increased the sustainability 
              of our home by massively reducing power and water consumption. Going forward, we will likely keep these changes, gradually 
              incorporating them into our daily lives. Whenever we see a light, device, or appliance that has been left on, we will switch 
              it off. We will naturally decrease the amount of time that we spend in the shower, and we will turn on new energy-saving 
              features on devices when we come across them.
